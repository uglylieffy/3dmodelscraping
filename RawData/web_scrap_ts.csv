T Rex Forever - 8K,Virtual creator,"The T. Rex is probably the largest land carnivor of all times, since Spinosaurus was a short legged marine animal, and this one really resembles the one in the movie Jurassic Park III. This may be the best T rex 3d model besides the ones in the cinema. """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""" Clean topology; Mesh subdivision; Real World Scale - 3.8 m hip height; Large 8192 pixel diffuse, normal, displacement, bump and specular maps; Jurassic Park Paddock breakout recreation scene and animations; Complete Rig and walking animation; Forward and Spot on walking animation provided. Paddock breakout animation; Eye and nose blinking and tongue lifting in max format; Naming convention; 3ds max 2017 native file; FBX, blend and OBJ formats provided.

It has no functioning rig, or animation or deformation. The FBX format has meshes and mapping coordinates and all animation, but every frame is keyed and the rig is very limited - controllers lose their use, but bones can be rotated. You have the walking animation and the other similar animations and poses or stills, but sometimes at the beginning of each animation, the first frames are a bit glitchy. You still have good animation in FBX, and it was very hard to be able to fix and export this format as it is now because the first exports were full of crazy errors. blender file has animation Maps for obj, blender and fbx are inside max folder.

For even greater realism and image motion improvement another Rendered can be used. Map Values are set in place in 3ds max, but for other softwares it may be useful to know that, in max: Body mesh subdivision should be 1 or 2, and is enough, or it will slow down the machine. Body Displacement map should not be set to more than 1 or 2 value; normal map 4, 5 or 6 value, and additional bump map to 0.4 or 0.5 at least. Body material, with daylight - material Specular Highlights - specular level - 115, Glosiness - 75, Maps Specular Level - 90. (I had to blend the diffuse normal map with the details normal map, but I also provide these two maps in separate for you to use how you wish) Tongue normal map should be set to 2 value. Tongue material, with daylight - material Specular Highlights - specular level - 129, Glosiness - 54, Maps Specular Level - 100. Map Specular level values in max material editor, and lights, affect force of shine. Adjustment of bumps, lights and shine really affects how the textures look like. I am not an expert on lights and shadows, but I know that the textures really have good colors and resolution, and are not too dark or too bright. When opening file, it will say that file ""lin doil.bmp"" is missing. Its an unnecessary map file that somehow got applied to a certain object in the scene, but I couldnt know which object was. All the important maps come along with this model.

Spinosaurus Diorama Swimming Skeleton,Hannah Lancer,"Swimming Spinosaurus: Spinosaurus (meaning spine lizard) is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what now is North Africa during the Cenomanian to upper Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period, about 99 to 93.5 million years ago.[2][3] This genus was known first from Egyptian remains discovered in 1912 and described by German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but additional material has come to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature. The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from Egypt, although a potential second species, S. maroccanus, has been recovered from Morocco. The contemporary spinosaurid genus Sigilmassasaurus has also been synonymized by some authors with S. aegyptiacus, though other researchers propose it to be a distinct taxon. Another possible junior synonym is Oxalaia from the Alcântara Formation in Brazil. Spinosaurus is the largest of all known terrestrial carnivores; other large carnivores comparable to Spinosaurus include theropods such as Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus. Estimates published in 2005, 2007, and 2008 suggested that it was between 12.6 to 18 meters (41 to 59 ft) in length and 7 to 20.9 metric tons (7.7 to 23.0 short tons) in weight.[4][5][6] New estimates published in 2014 and 2018, based on a more complete specimen, supported the earlier research, finding that Spinosaurus could reach lengths of 15 to 16 meters (49 to 52 ft).[7][8][9] The latest estimates suggest a weight of 6.4 to 7.5 metric tons (7.1 to 8.3 short tons).[8][9] The skull of Spinosaurus was long, low and narrow, similar to that of a modern crocodilian, and bore straight conical teeth with no serrations. It would have had large, robust forelimbs bearing three-fingered hands, with an enlarged claw on the first digit. The distinctive neural spines of Spinosaurus, which were long extensions of the vertebrae (or backbones), grew to at least 1.65 meters (5.4 ft) long and were likely to have had skin connecting them, forming a sail-like structure, although some authors[who?] have suggested that the spines were covered in fat and formed a hump. Spinosaurus's hip bones were reduced, and the legs were very short in proportion to the body. Its long and narrow tail was deepened by tall, thin neural spines and elongated chevrons, forming a flexible fin or paddle-like structure. Spinosaurus is known to have eaten fish, and most scientists believe that it hunted both terrestrial and aquatic prey. Evidence suggests that it was highly semiaquatic, and lived both on land and in water much like modern crocodilians do. Spinosaurus's leg bones had osteosclerosis (high bone density), allowing for better buoyancy control, and the paddle-like tail was likely used for underwater propulsion. Multiple functions have been put forward for the dorsal sail, including thermoregulation and display; either to intimidate rivals or attract mates. Spinosaurus lived in a humid environment of tidal flats and mangrove forests alongside many other dinosaurs, as well as fish, crocodylomorphs, lizards, turtles, pterosaurs, and plesiosaurs.

T-rex Skeleton,Joseclemente,"This is an idealized model of Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton. My aim was to offer a multipurpose model, good enough in accuracy to be used in an high-end project, but also optimized in polygons count to be useable in a real time environnement. This is not a scientific representation of an average fossile. For this model the first goal was the theatrical aspect: The skull is bigger, with an expressive face.The dentition is complete. The legs are also slightly longer than an actual T-rex. But all the principal characteristics an details of a real fossile have been carefuly reproduced. NOTES Originally created in 3DSMax 2010 Preview images rendered with default Scanline renderer, no postwork In some images, elements have been isolated for clarity No 3rd party plug-ins required to run the file No background, render setup or lighting are included in the scene This model is presented in a basic symmetrical standing pose. However, if you need a specific pose (running, roaring...) i can easily make it. Each of the 258 bones (plus 60 teeth) has ben individually modeled and unwrapped. The inner skull has been completely and precisely modeled. This model has been created with rigging and animation in mind, and all the joints are designed for it. If you want to rig it yourself, i provide a file including the points for all the axes of the joints. GEOMETRY The model is made up with one object (328 sub-objects) Model created for subdivision 100% quads geometry Total polygons count: 67495 quads Built to real-world scale in centimeters units The model length is about 13 meters TEXTURES & MATERIALS Standard materials only The model is fully and carefully unwrapped into two different UV spaces: one for the head, one for the body All texture maps are lossless .PNG 4096*4096 The bumpiness is generated by a normal map with an additional regular bump map Two different sets of texture for head and body: -color, bump, normal The two 16bits .tiff displacement maps (head & body) are provided but not applied The .PSD editable texture files are available for download.

Velociraptor Skeleton Diorama with T-Rex,Hannah Lancer,"The Velociraptor Velociraptor (/v??l?s?ræpt?r/; meaning swift seizer in Latin)[1] is a genus of dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived approximately 75 to 71 million years ago during the later part of the Cretaceous Period.[2] Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species have been discovered in Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from Inner Mongolia, China. Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and disembowel prey. Velociraptor can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. Velociraptor (commonly shortened to raptor) is one of the dinosaur genera most familiar to the general public due to its prominent role in the Jurassic Park motion picture series. In real life, however, Velociraptor was roughly the size of a turkey, considerably smaller than the approximately 2 m (7 ft) tall and 80 kg (180 lb) reptiles seen in the films (which were based on members of the related genus Deinonychus). Today, Velociraptor is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons, the most of any dromaeosaurid. One particularly famous specimen preserves a Velociraptor locked in combat with a Protoceratops. Here is a scene where the Velociraptorskeleton stand on top on a T-Rex Skull.

Velociraptor Skeleton Meme Diorama Philosoraptor,Hannah Lancer,"Philosoraptor is an advice animal image macro series featuring an illustration of a Velociraptor paired with captions depicting the dinosaur as being deeply immersed in metaphysical inquiries or unraveling quirky paradoxes. Origin On October 8th, 2008, the original illustration of the Philosoraptor was released and copyrighted by creator Sam Smith as a T-shirt design for sale on the online retailer Lonely Dinosaur. In an e-mail exchange with Know Your Meme, Smith revealed that the idea for Philosoraptor image was conceived sometime in the early of summer of 2008. The final image wasn't created until late summer and the t-shirts went into production in August and September that year. The image itself was a mix of several images of velociraptors I got online, which I compressed to one-color images, then mixed together. I took the jaw off of one at the mouth, and cut it open to make the mouth look like it was hanging open. The claw was based off an image of an eagle talon that I flattened, drew in some bits, and moved and enlarged one of them to make the raptor-like claw. The last thing I did was nudge the eye slit over to the right like three times, and that pulled it all together- really gives him that far-away look. It was inspired by our friend Devin, who was a philosophy major and was always hunched over his desk thinking, so we called him the philosoraptor. We had never heard of it before at the time, but apparently the joke had been made previously on the interwebs. On 4chan On March 30th, 2007,[3] the earliest known depiction of a Philosoraptor dinosaur was posted on YTMND page titled New species of dinosaur discovered!, featuring a photoshopped image of a Velociraptor from the 1993 action film Jurassic Park holding a copy of Plato's complete works (shown below, left). On February 18th, 2009, the earliest archived appearance of an image macro featuring the Lonely Dinosaur illustration was posted on 4chan /b/ board.

T-Rex Skeleton - Leo Burton,Hannah Lancer,"Hi Everyone =) I Mixed up these nice T-Rex Skeleton =D Its very easy to print On the most parts you dont need any support I like the Leo Burton Mount so i created it =D HF printig it =) Tyrannosaurus is a genus of large theropod dinosaur. The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning king in Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. Tyrannosaurus lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, the forelimbs of Tyrannosaurus were short but unusually powerful for their size, and they had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 meters (40 feet) in length, though T. rex could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.96 m (13 ft) tall at the hips, and according to most modern estimates 6 metric tons (6.6 short tons) to 8 metric tons (8.8 short tons) in weight. Although other theropods rivaled or exceeded Tyrannosaurus rex in size, it is still among the largest known land predators and is estimated to have exerted the strongest bite force among all terrestrial animals. By far the largest carnivore in its environment, Tyrannosaurus rex was most likely an apex predator, preying upon hadrosaurs, juvenile armored herbivores like ceratopsians and ankylosaurs, and possibly sauropods. Some experts have suggested the dinosaur was primarily a scavenger. The question of whether Tyrannosaurus was an apex predator or a pure scavenger was among the longest debates in paleontology. Most paleontologists today accept that Tyrannosaurus was both an active predator and a scavenger. Specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex include some that are nearly complete skeletons. Soft tissue and proteins have been reported in at least one of these specimens. The abundance of fossil material has allowed significant research into many aspects of its biology, including its life history and biomechanics. The feeding habits, physiology, and potential speed of Tyrannosaurus rex are a few subjects of debate. Its taxonomy is also controversial, as some scientists consider Tarbosaurus bataar from Asia to be a second Tyrannosaurus species, while others maintain Tarbosaurus is a separate genus. Several other genera of North American tyrannosaurids have also been synonymized with Tyrannosaurus. As the archetypal theropod, Tyrannosaurus has been one of the best-known dinosaurs since the early 20th century and has been featured in film, advertising, postal stamps, and many other media.

Ankylosaurus Skull 3D print model,hasanoztrk,"This is a life size 3d digital model skull of Ankylosaurus. OBJ, ZTL, PLY, FBX and STL files. jaw is seperated. Ankylosaurus[nb 1] is a genus of armored dinosaur. Its fossils have been found in geological formations dating to the very end of the Cretaceous Period, about 68–66 million years ago, in western North America, making it among the last of the non-avian dinosaurs. It was named by Barnum Brown in 1908; it is monotypic, containing only A. magniventris. The generic name means fused or bent lizard, and the specific name means great belly. A handful of specimens have been excavated to date, but a complete skeleton has not been discovered. Though other members of Ankylosauria are represented by more extensive fossil material, Ankylosaurus is often considered the archetypal member of its group, despite having some unusual features. Possibly the largest-known ankylosaurid, Ankylosaurus is estimated to have been between 6 and 8 meters (20 and 26 ft) long and to have weighed between 4.8 and 8 metric tons (5.3 and 8.8 short tons). It was quadrupedal, with a broad, robust body. It had a wide, low skull, with two horns pointing backward from the back of the head, and two horns below these that pointed backward and down. Unlike other ankylosaurs, its nostrils faced sideways rather than towards the front. The front part of the jaws was covered in a beak, with rows of small, leaf-shaped teeth farther behind it. It was covered in armor plates, or osteoderms, with bony half-rings covering the neck, and had a large club on the end of its tail. Bones in the skull and other parts of the body were fused, increasing their strength, and this feature is the source of the genus name.

Riggs in 1903 from fossils found in the Colorado River valley in western Colorado, United States. Riggs named the dinosaur Brachiosaurus altithorax; the generic name is Greek for arm lizard, in reference to its proportionately long arms, and the specific name means deep chest. Brachiosaurus is estimated to have been between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 ft) long; body mass estimates of the subadult holotype specimen range from 28.3 to 46.9 metric tons (31.2 and 51.7 short tons). It had a disproportionately long neck, small skull, and large overall size, all of which are typical for sauropods.

The only species is Carnotaurus sastrei. Known from a single well-preserved skeleton, it is one of the best-understood theropods from the Southern Hemisphere. The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. Carnotaurus is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous.

Two species are currently recognized, although others have been assigned in the past. The type species is V. mongoliensis; fossils of this species have been discovered in the Djadochta Formation, Mongolia. A second species, V. osmolskae, was named in 2008 for skull material from the Bayan Mandahu Formation, China.. Smaller than other dromaeosaurids like Deinonychus and Achillobator, Velociraptor was about 1.5–2.07 m (4.9–6.8 ft) long with a body mass between 15–18.3 kg (33–40 lb). It nevertheless shared many of the same anatomical features. It was a bipedal, feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and restrain prey.

It lived during the Late Cretaceous Period (Maastrichtian stage) of what is now North America. Remains have been excavated in Montana, South Dakota, Wyoming, and Alberta. It was a herbivorous creature which is primarily known from a single skull and a few extremely thick skull roofs, at 22 centimetres (9 inches) thick. More complete fossils have been found in recent years. Pachycephalosaurus was among the last non-avian dinosaurs before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.

Tyrannosaurus Rex,ToothedJaw,"This model is of one of the largest predators on earth: Tyrannosaurus rex. This model includes the exterior mesh: the rex model itself, a skeleton which fits into and operates underneath the exterior mesh, and a pair of eyes. Each model has its own texture. The model also includes an armature and animations. Two animations exist: a walk cycle and a roar cycle. Some of the armature pieces have been modified to copy the rotation of others to provide a more accurate and smooth look. For example, many of the neck and tail armatures have a copied rotation and therefore when the base of the tail is moved, the rest will curve with it. The model is currently equipped with a subdivision modifier to make the animal look smoother. This modifier can be adjusted or removed. Tyrannosaurus Rex lived in the Midwestern United States alongside some of history's most famous dinosaurs such as the Triceratops Horridus.

Raptor,Gnimmel,"This character is fully rigged and ready to animate in Maya 5 complete or higher.

Pose space drivers are driven by expressions so no third party plug-ins are required. Both arms and legs can be animated in FK or IK and blended between. The spine and neck both use a stretchy spine set up so all controls can be independently posed. Stretch gages are visible on the controls so the animator knows how far he/she is stretching the creature. The tail contains an automatic secondary motion expression which gives the tail a more fluid motion when turned on. The secondary motion can be controlled by a weight attribute which can also be turned off for full control. The rig also contains a proxy rig to allow animators real time feed back while animating. The render mesh is also linked to a subdivision control which subdivides the mesh for smoother renders.
