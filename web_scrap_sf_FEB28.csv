Ever since that time, numerous fossils of Titanosaurs were found all over the planet except in the north and central parts of North America and Antarctica. Paleontologists have described around 50 species of titanosaurus so far. Common features for all species are unique morphology of vertebrae and fact that all species are described based on the partial fossil samples. Despite the similarities in the morphology of bones of described species of Titanosaurus, only two species are currently classified as ‚Äútrue‚Äù Titanosaurus species, while others are assigned into other genera of dinosaurs.']",0,76,355,10,n/a,https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/titanosaurus-cc65ea57a17e48b790bcd8bda9d0524a

The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but additional material came to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature. The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from Egypt, although a potential second species, S. maroccanus, has been recovered from Morocco. The contemporary spinosaurid genus Sigilmassasaurus has also been synonymized by some authors with S. aegyptiacus, though other researchers propose it to be a distinct taxon. Another possible junior synonym is Oxalaia from the Alc√¢ntara Formation in Brazil.']",0,6,34,2,n/a,https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/low-poly-spinosaurus-bb4b1f3fad4746aeb01e4564db82e6b3
